        Created and launched a meteorological balloon to test wind conditions up to 30km high to determine the suitability for rocket launches 
    <br>	       
        Designed and soldered circuits for electrical components, focusing on lightness and efficiency due to the limited payload capacity of the balloon 
    <br>	
        Programmed an Arduino to take input from sensors and regularly transmit data 
        <br>
