<h2> TECHNICAL PROJECTS </h2>

<div class="emailana">
    <h3 class="bold"> Email Analyzer </h3>
    <p class="italic">Java</p>
    <p class="big">
        Used graph theory to collect advanced metrics regarding interactions, whilst using metrics to filter such interactions through Java programming 
    <br>
        Parsed through a text file to create directed and undirected graphs 
    <br>
        Generated reports on certain users and time frames, as well as compared users based on different types of activity 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="textana">
    <h3 class="bold"> Text Document Analysis </h3>
    <p  class="italic">Java</p>
    <p class="big">
        Created a document analyzer using Java that parsed through websites or text files to determine sentence and word level metrics, and similarity 
    <br>
        Developed algorithms to perform linguistic analysis using the Google Sentiment Analysis API 
    <br>
        Compared documents and partitioned them accordingly using similarity metrics ‚óè Tested application using JUnit and regression testing 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="claw">
    <h3 class="bold"> Arduino Robotic Claw </h3>
    <p class="italic">C</p>
    <p class="big">
        Mechanically developed an autonomous claw that senses and picks up objects of various shapes and sizes, ranging from an almond to a full pop can
    <br>
        Led development of firmware for functionality of mechanical components of claw using C and the Arduino IDE 
    <br>
        Prototyped and tested various mechanical iterations to optimize design and precision 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="chair">
    <h3 class="bold"> Cardboard Chair </h3>
    <p class="italic">Mechanical Design</p>
    <p class="big"> Created a full-sized chair purely out of cardboard that held over 300 pounds without breaking 
        <br>
        Used interlocking supports to maximize strength and prioritized the user through back and arm supports for ergonomic strength 
        <br>
        Placed first out of 6 teams by using rapid full-scale prototyping with cardboard to analyze areas of weakness
